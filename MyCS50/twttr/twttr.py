# When texting or tweeting, itâ€™s not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space,
# as by omitting vowels, much like Twitter was originally called twttr.
# In a file called twttr.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a str of text
# and then outputs that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted,
# whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.

        no_vowels = convert(text, VOWELS)
        # print(f"Your text without vowels is: {no_vowels}")
        print(f"{no_vowels}")
